 party for Benjamin’s birthday. Benjamin was somewhat surprised as he and Olivia just broke
 up and had a tough time. Out of curiosity, Benjamin asked Felix how he knew about the party,

 city. William said that Olivia told him she felt sorry because of the breakup with Benjamin
 and decided to organize a surprise party to show Benjamin that she still liked him. Benjamin
 was skeptical about everything Felix had just said. Still, Felix assured Benjamin that he told
 the truth, as Olivia is very good at keeping secrets. The boys then decided to go out and
 spent the whole night in the city center. The next day, Benjamin wondered whether Felix was
 telling the truth about the surprise party. Benjamin suspected that Felix had just pranked
 him. Later that day, Benjamin met Olivia in the living room and decided to ask about the
 party. Olivia was surprised that William had told Felix about the party. Olivia said she did
